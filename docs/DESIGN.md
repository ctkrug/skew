# Design direction

## Aesthetic direction

Leap Second is a **blueprint/technical instrument**: crisp navy ink linework on a warm
drafting-paper background, like a schematic for a clock rather than a screenshot of one.
No dark-mode dashboard, no glassy cards — this is a precision instrument panel you'd trust
to tell you the truth about time.

## Tokens

| Token | Value | Use |
|---|---|---|
| `--bg` | `#f2ede3` | page background — warm drafting paper |
| `--surface-1` | `#ffffff` | primary panel surface (clock faces, cards) |
| `--surface-2` | `#e9e2d1` | secondary/recessed surface (panel headers, track backgrounds) |
| `--text` | `#16213a` | primary ink — deep navy, near-black |
| `--text-muted` | `#5b6b82` | secondary ink — captions, labels, timestamps |
| `--accent` | `#e2572b` | signal accent — the leap second itself, countdown emphasis |
| `--accent-support` | `#2a5c8a` | support accent — TAI/GPS linework, secondary emphasis |
| `--success` | `#2f855a` | positive/confirmed states |
| `--danger` | `#c23b3b` | error states |
| `--border` | `#16213a` at 15% opacity | hairline schematic borders |

**Type pairing:** [JetBrains Mono](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/JetBrains+Mono) for
the wordmark, headings, and all ticking digits (a monospace face reads as *instrumentation*,
and keeps digit columns from jittering as they tick); [IBM Plex Sans](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/IBM+Plex+Sans)
for body copy and labels. System fallback stack: `ui-monospace, "SF Mono", monospace` and
`-apple-system, "Segoe UI", sans-serif` respectively.

**Spacing unit:** 8px scale (8/16/24/32/48/64).

**Corner radius:** 4px — sharp enough to read as drafted, not soft as glass.

**Shadow/depth:** no soft glows. Panels get a 1px hairline navy border plus a crisp
2px-offset flat shadow (`2px 2px 0 rgba(22,33,58,0.12)`), like a stamped drafting stencil.
Background carries a very faint grid (blueprint graph-paper lines at ~40px, 4% opacity)
for atmosphere without competing with content.

**Motion:** UI transitions 150ms ease-out. The ticking second digits roll like a mechanical
counter over ~100ms rather than snapping.

## Layout intent

The hero is the **three clock readouts** (UTC / TAI / GPS), each its own instrument panel
with a large monospace digital readout and, beneath it, a thin SVG offset bar showing how
far that clock sits from UTC. Below the three panels, one full-width panel holds the
countdown + odds tracker.

- **1440×900 desktop:** three clock panels in a row, each ~30% width, filling the top ~55%
  of the viewport; the countdown/odds panel spans full width beneath, filling the rest.
  No dead margins — panels use the full content width with 24px gutters.
- **390×844 phone:** three clock panels stack vertically, each full-width and tall enough
  to read at a glance (no horizontal scroll); countdown/odds panel follows, also full-width.

## Signature detail

When the seconds counter on the UTC clock reaches `:59`, a dashed leader line and small
annotation callout — in the style of a technical drawing dimension marker — sweeps in from
the panel edge to label the exact TAI/GPS gap at that instant ("+37s", "+18s"), then
retracts. It's the one moment the page explicitly points at the thing it exists to show.

## Notes for BUILD

- Build all three clock faces and the offset bars as inline SVG so the annotation callout
  can be drawn with real coordinates, not overlaid HTML.
- This is a dev-tool, not a game — no SFX/juice plan needed; motion stays subtle and
  functional (ticking digits, the annotation sweep, hover/focus states).
- Respect `prefers-reduced-motion`: freeze the digit roll and annotation sweep to instant
  swaps.
